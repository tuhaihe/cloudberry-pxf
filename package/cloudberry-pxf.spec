%description
Apache Cloudberry PXF (Platform Extension Framework) is an advanced data
access framework that provides connectivity to a wide range of data
sources. It enables high-speed, parallel data access across
distributed systems, making it an essential component for performing
advanced analytics with the Apache Cloudberry. PXF seamlessly
integrates and efficiently queries external data sources, including,
but not limited to:

- HDFS files
- Hive tables
- HBase tables
- Databases that support JDBC
- Cloud-based data stores such as Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage (GCS)

Supported file formats include, but are not limited to:

- Text files (e.g., CSV, TSV)
- Sequence files
- Avro files
- Parquet files
- ORC files
- RCFile (Record Columnar File)
- JSON files
- Avro Object Container Files

Whether accessing structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data,
PXF ensures that users can efficiently interact with a diverse set of
data environments and file formats. The examples provided above
represent only a subset of the broad range of sources and formats
supported by PXF.

# If a file is not marked as a config file, or if a file has not been altered
# since installation, then it will be silently replaced by the version from the
# RPM.

# If a config file has been edited on disk, but is not actually different from
# the file in the RPM then the edited version will be silently left in place.

# When a config file has been edited and is different from the file in
# the RPM, then the behavior is the following:
# - %config(noreplace): The edited version will be left in place, and the new
#                       version will be installed with an .rpmnew suffix.
# - %config: The new file will be installed, and the the old edited version
#            will be renamed with an .rpmsave suffix.
