If you plan to upgrade the operating system on your Apache Cloudberry cluster hosts and you are running PXF in your Apache Cloudberry installation, you must perform some PXF-specific actions before and after you upgrade the OS.

For the operating system versions supported by your Apache Cloudberry release, refer to [Supported Platforms](../intro/intro_pxf.md#supported-platforms).

The following procedures assume that you are upgrading the OS on a different set of hosts than that of the current/running Apache Cloudberry cluster.

## Pre-OS Upgrade Actions

Perform the following steps before you upgrade the operating system:

1. Upgrade PXF in your current cluster to the latest release and verify PXF operation **before** you commence the OS upgrade.

1. Retain the following PXF user configuration directories, typically located in `/usr/local/cloudberry-pxf`: `conf/`, `keytabs/`, `lib/`, and `servers/`. If you relocated `$PXF_BASE`, retain the configuration in that directory.


## Post-OS Upgrade Actions

After you upgrade the operating system and install, configure, and verify Apache Cloudberry on the new set of hosts, perform the following procedure:

1. Download a PXF package for the upgraded OS from the [Apache Cloudberry PXF releases](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry-pxf/releases). *You must download the same version of PXF as the version that was running on the original Apache Cloudberry cluster.*

1. Install PXF for the upgraded OS on all Apache Cloudberry hosts.

1. Copy the PXF configuration files from the original cluster to `/usr/local/cloudberry-pxf` on the upgraded OS Apache Cloudberry coordinator host. If you choose to [relocate $PXF_BASE](../administering/configuring/about_pxf_dir.md#relocating-pxf_base), copy the configuration to that directory instead.

1. Synchronize the PXF configuration to all hosts in the Apache Cloudberry cluster:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@coordinator$ pxf cluster sync
    ```

1. Start PXF on each Apache Cloudberry host:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@coordinator$ pxf cluster start
    ```

1. Verify that PXF can access each external data source by querying external tables that specify each PXF server configuration.
