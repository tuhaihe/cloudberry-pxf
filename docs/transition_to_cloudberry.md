The transition of the PXF project to **Apache Cloudberry (Incubating)** involves a significant rebranding effort. As part of this transition, the Java package namespace has been changed from `org.greenplum` to `org.apache.cloudberry`.

This is a user-facing breaking change. If you have customized PXF configuration files in your `$PXF_BASE/conf` directory, you must manually update these files to use the new package names.

## Required Configuration Updates

### Profile Configurations (`pxf-profiles-default.xml`)

PXF uses profiles to define how to access different data sources. These profiles specify Java classes for fragmenters, accessors, and resolvers.

**Action Required**: If you have created custom profiles or overridden default profiles in `pxf-profiles-default.xml` or other `.xml` files in the `conf` directory, you must replace all occurrences of `org.greenplum.pxf` with `org.apache.cloudberry.pxf`.

**Example**:
Old configuration:
```xml
<fragmenter>org.greenplum.pxf.plugins.hdfs.HdfsDataFragmenter</fragmenter>
```
New configuration:
```xml
<fragmenter>org.apache.cloudberry.pxf.plugins.hdfs.HdfsDataFragmenter</fragmenter>
```

### Logging Configuration (`pxf-log4j2.xml`)

The logging configuration uses the package names to define loggers and their levels.

**Action Required**: Update your `$PXF_BASE/conf/pxf-log4j2.xml` file to use the new logger names.

**Example**:
Old configuration:
```xml
<Logger name="org.greenplum.pxf" level="${env:PXF_LOG_LEVEL:-${spring:pxf.log.level}}"/>
```
New configuration:
```xml
<Logger name="org.apache.cloudberry.pxf" level="${env:PXF_LOG_LEVEL:-${spring:pxf.log.level}}"/>
```

### Existing External Tables

If you have created external tables that explicitly specify a class name in the `LOCATION` clause (using `&FRAGMENTER=...`, `&ACCESSOR=...`, or `&RESOLVER=...`), these tables will fail until they are updated to use the new package names.

**Action Required**: Drop and recreate any external tables that refer to classes in the `org.greenplum` namespace.

**Example**:
Old DDL:
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_table (...)
LOCATION ('pxf://path/to/data?FRAGMENTER=org.greenplum.pxf.api.examples.DemoFragmenter&...')
FORMAT 'CUSTOM' (FORMATTER='pxfwritable_import');
```
New DDL:
```sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE my_table (...)
LOCATION ('pxf://path/to/data?FRAGMENTER=org.apache.cloudberry.pxf.api.examples.DemoFragmenter&...')
FORMAT 'CUSTOM' (FORMATTER='pxfwritable_import');
```

:::note
Tables using built-in profiles (e.g., `?PROFILE=hdfs:text`) do not need DDL changes, provided that the underlying profile definition in `pxf-profiles-default.xml` has been updated.
:::

## Why This Change?

This change aligns the PXF project with the **Apache Software Foundation** standards and the **Apache Cloudberry** branding. Using the `org.apache.cloudberry` namespace ensures consistency with other Apache projects and reflects the project's new home.
