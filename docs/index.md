The Apache Cloudberry Platform Extension Framework (PXF) provides parallel, high throughput data access and federated queries across heterogeneous data sources via built-in connectors that map an Apache Cloudberry external table definition to an external data source. PXF has its roots in the Apache HAWQ project.

[Apache Cloudberry PXF](https://github.com/apache/cloudberry-pxf) is derived from the now-archived [`greenplum-db/pxf-archive`](https://github.com/greenplum-db/pxf-archive) project (at version 6.10.1-SNAPSHOT). It has been extensively customized and optimized for Apache Cloudberry, and now evolves independently with its own release cadence.

:::note

This documentation is derived from the original `greenplum-db/pxf-archive` 6.10.1 documentation. Content has been added, revised, and removed to reflect the actual behavior of Apache Cloudberry PXF.
